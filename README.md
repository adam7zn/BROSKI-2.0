# Math Study Companion

A personal, timeline-aware mathematics study companion for one student, one course, and one textbook.

The companion combines the current course plan, textbook content, and the student's previous answers to decide what is most useful now: retrieve an older concept, practise current material, prepare for an upcoming lesson, diagnose a misconception, explain a concept, or stay silent.

## Product goal

The student should rarely need to explain what they are studying. The system should already know:

- what the class covered previously;
- what the class is studying now;
- what is coming next;
- which textbook material corresponds to each lesson;
- which concepts the student remembers or struggles with;
- when a short study interaction would be useful.

The first complete loop is:

```text
course timeline + textbook + learning history
                    ↓
          choose the next study item
                    ↓
              send a question
                    ↓
             evaluate the reply
                    ↓
       store evidence and schedule review
                    ↓
               send feedback
```

## MVP boundaries

The first version supports:

- one student: William;
- one mathematics course;
- one exact textbook;
- one course plan, initially imported manually if needed;
- one provider-neutral messaging interface;
- short review, practice, and preparation interactions;
- evidence-based review scheduling and misconception tracking.

It does not initially support multiple schools, a general textbook marketplace, every subject, high-stakes grading, or fully autonomous messaging without a shadow-mode pilot.

## Two-person team workstreams

- **Person A — Conversation:** messaging, conversation state, and one simple question-and-feedback agent.
- **Person B — Platform and visuals:** backend, database, APIs, images, files, logs, and deployment.

The first phases use only two shared payloads so both people can build independently with fixtures. [Delivery phases](docs/PHASES.md) is the source of truth for current work. [Team ownership](docs/TEAM_OWNERSHIP.md) records broader responsibilities that may become useful after the first real-message loop works.

## Current milestone

First prove each half independently, then connect this manually triggered loop:

```text
backend context
→ one simple question
→ student reply
→ useful feedback
→ saved interaction
```

See [Delivery phases](docs/PHASES.md) for implementation order. The [Initial backlog](docs/INITIAL_BACKLOG.md) is deferred reference material for later phases.
